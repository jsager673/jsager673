- Hello! My name is John Sager and I am an independent game developer working primarily in UE4 and Unity. I am also an adjunct teaching
Game Design & 3D Modeling for gaming. 

- I have worked on and finished several games that are available on Itch.io, including Canis (a simple shmup), Skullcrusher (breakout clone), 
Protectron (similar to missile command but no shooting), and MGI Pinball. I also programmed the educational game Percy's Adventure for the Lewis & Clark Interpretive Center in Sioux City, IA.

- I am currently working on an FPS project named Wode and hope to have an early playable version by the end of the year.

- I'm always looking for interesting projects so hit me up if you have any job opportunities and that you think I'd be interested in!

- Feel free to contact me at johnsager@gmail.com and check out https://jsagerdev.wordpress.com/ for updates on my projects.
